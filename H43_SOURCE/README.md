**Install Python 3.6+**


**Install dependencies**

```Run this command in terminal (e.g CMD): pip3 install -U discord.py            (if no pip3 then try only pip)```
```If error shows up try: python -m pip install -U discord.py```
```If still shows the same error ('command not recognized') u need to add python as a system variable and try again```

Then to execute the script:

    1. Open Terminal
    
    2. Run `python3 h43.py` (if `python3` doesn't work try `py` and `python`)
    
    3. Have fun! (If you don't know how to work with it go back to parent directory and follow the instructions in README.md)
