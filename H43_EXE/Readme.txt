Use debug.bat if your "H43 BOT".exe is closing and u don't know why. Maybe the problem is with config.ini.

What does this BOT do?
Destruction (Deletes all roles/channels, Kicks/Bans Members, Edit Overview)

Spam (Spams Roles/Channels, Edit Overview)

Invites (Invites Server's Bot is in and unbans you from them)

OP (Give yourself the best role [Maybe administrator])

DEOP (Remove all possible roles [permissions] form a member in a server)



Steps

I. Create a Discord Bot

Acess this website, create a Discord Bot and copy the Token given
website: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/


II. Open config.ini and edit it

In "Users" you can add as many as you want following the same format written. (Note: Name doesn't matter only ID next to it). These exploit_users are the users that have acess to your bot's commands. Note: You need to enable Developer mode to get the users' ID!
In "CooldownBypass" you can either set true or false. There is a cooldown in each command so you don't abuse them thinking it didn't work. If you want u can replace the false by true anytime you want.
In "OfflineMode" you can either set true or false. Even if you set it to true it wont change bot's status if another instance of the bot is running. It will only not make bot's status online.
In "Token" you can either write the token or leave it blank (default) if you don't want to write the token inside the file you can write it when the bot starts up however, you will have to paste in terminal everytime you start the bot


III. Execute the executable


IV. Paste the token in the terminal

You can skip this step if you wrote the token inside the config.ini


V. Invite the Bot to the server (Persuade them to invite your bot)

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=ID&scope=bot&permissions=8 Change 'ID' for your BOT's ID and send the link to your friend Note: If you think people never add bots that have permission n.º 8 (administrator) just change it to another number that has the same permissions (e.g Administrator + every other = Administrator, n.º 2146958847)


VI. Check Help for commands

If you write H43?help in bot's DM or in a server where the bot is, it will DM you with the help (commands)



Warnings:
Use this at your own risk. Your bot can be banned and user too.

Please don't try to destroy people lives... For last, have fun!
