I started this project back in 2018 (didn't change much since then xD, not enough time for it) thinking about fun tools to prank my friends and as a way to gain more experience.

I know people might use this for bad purposes but that's not my fault, I only have the intention to share my project with you. The ones that must be careful are the servers' owners.

You might be asking why I didn't put Mass DM as a command since that is such a recognized one. The answer is obvious... This wasn't made to annoy everyone in a server but to "prank" friend's servers....

If you want you can give me feedback for me to improve. One of the reasons I built this was to learn programming (the other reason is above xD). 

When I have time I'll try to make this code better and add more feautures! :D

To prank your friend you will need to convince your friend to add the bot into his server, then you can execute the commands if u followed all the steps (Down) correctly!

**Please read the last part at least if you want to skip the steps** 

# What does this BOT do?
**Destruction**
Deletes all roles/channels

Kicks/Bans Members

Edit Overview

**Spam**
Spams Roles/Channels

Edit Overview

**Invites**
Invites Server's Bot is in and unbans you from them

**OP**
Give yourself the best role (Maybe administrator)

**DEOP**
Remove all possible roles (permissions) form a member in a server


# Steps

If you are on windows you can use H43_EXE instead of the source. But don't forget to read all of this or you will be lost.

I. **Create a Discord Bot**

```Acess ```[this website](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)```, create a Discord Bot and copy the Token given```

website: ```https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/```


II. **Open config.ini and edit** (Maybe notepadd++)

```In "Users" you can add as many as you want following the same format written. (Note: Name doesn't matter only ID next to it). These exploit_users are the users that have acess to your bot's commands. Note: You need to enable Developer mode to get users' ID!```

```In "CooldownBypass" you can either set true or false. There is a cooldown in each command so you don't abuse them thinking it didn't work. If you want u can replace the false by true anytime you want.```

```In "OfflineMode" you can either set true or false. Even if you set it to true it wont change bot's status if another instance of the bot is running. It will only not make bot's status online.```

```In "Token" you can either write the token or leave it blank (default) if you don't want to write the token inside the file you can write it when the bot starts up however, you will have to paste in terminal everytime you start the bot```

III. **Execute the script or executable depending on your OS**

IV. **Paste the token given before in the terminal**

```You can skip this step if you wrote the token inside the config.ini```

V. **Invite the Bot to the server (Persuade them to invite your bot)**

```https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&permissions=8&client_id=ID       Change 'ID' for your BOT's ID and send the link to your friend```
```Note: If you think people never add bots that have permission n.ยบ 8 (administrator) just change it to another number that has the same permissions (e.g Administrator + every other = Administrator, n.ยบ 2146958847)```

VI. **Check Help for commands**

```If you write H43?help in bot's DM or in a server where the bot is, it will DM you with the help (commands)```

## Warnings:
Use this at your own risk. Your bot can be banned and user too.
